# ✅ UI Enhancements: Landing Page

## 🎨 Visual Upgrades
I've significantly improved the **Login / Landing Page** with smooth animations and better interaction design.

### 🌟 New Features
1.  **Framer Motion Integration:**
    *   Installed `framer-motion` library.
    *   **Hero Section:** The title and logo now slide up gracefully on load.
    *   **Stats:** Numbers and icons fade in when you scroll to them.
    *   **Role Cards:** They now appear one-by-one (staggered effect) for a polished feel.

2.  **Smooth Transitions:**
    *   **Login Form:** When you select a role, the login form slides into view smoothly instead of just popping in.
    *   **Back Button:** Collapses the form gently.

3.  **Modern Feel:**
    *   Added `hover:scale` effects to the Logo and Cards.
    *   Improved glassmorphism and spacing in the layout.

## 🚀 How to Validate
1.  Refresh the page.
2.  Watch the Logo and Title slide up.
3.  Scroll down to see the Role Cards animate in.
4.  Click a **Role Card** (e.g., Citizen).
5.  Notice how the Login Form expands smoothly from nothing.

This delivers the "smooth and attractive" experience you requested!
